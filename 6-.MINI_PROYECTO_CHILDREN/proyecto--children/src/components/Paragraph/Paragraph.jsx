The Mayans were conquered by the Toltecs, and the Toltecs are believed to be the first to domesticate the Techichi and bring the dogs into the home as pets. The Toltecs also used the Techichis for religious purposes, food, and companions and some believed the dogs were sacred. Techichis have been depicted in Mayan, Aztec, and Toltec writings and drawings found in ancient tombs and pyramids. In 1850, Techichi dogs were found in the Mexican state of Chihuahua near old ruins built by Emperor Montezuma. When explorers came searching for the new world, it is believed that the Techichi bred with a canine species brought over by the explorers. This resulted in the Chihuahua we have today.'
